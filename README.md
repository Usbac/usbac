## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

### I'm Usbac ðŸ¦„ I'm currently building new things for me and the world.

I work at different levels of abstraction, but at the end I just make a computer go beep boop ðŸ’».

I believe in the power of open source software, you can join me in this adventure by contribuiting to my different projects.

In my free time I make educational [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCeUQR6IkewQvH8RCKng52Tw) videos about software development in my native language Spanish.

I focus on web development and everything related to the C programming language.

_Unicorns are awesome._
